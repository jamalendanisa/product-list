### Hello, I'm Anisa Jamalenda,
you could contact me to anisa.jamalenda@gmail.com.

I would like to apologize for the delay and for giving my task after the deadline.
Hereby my explanation about this assessment.

I build this assessment with Create React App for it to be easier and faster building. I use Redux Saga and Axios as
middleware and API caller because it would be easier to manage and more efficient to execute asynchronous actions like fetching data from API. 

I try to make the UI as close as the given design while looking Catch's website as referrences and adding the rest using my imagination. I have done the responsive UI application too so it could open nicely and works on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes. Also done the test but I apologize for not at full coverage since i just learn the Jest and Enzyme for quite sometime but of course would love to learn in more. I handle the CORS with adding 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/' on the API URL, it's an 'easy' fix for now. Because CORS should be allowed in backend after all, that's what i know for now after researching the internet. Still will learn some more. I received cookie warning when i attached Catch's url link but I leave it for now. Would try to fix it in the future.

I think that is from me for now. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Hope i could pass to the next step and be a part of your team.

Have a nice day.

Anisa Jamalenda


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
